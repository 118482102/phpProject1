        <div> I enjoy travelling and first left the country when i was 11 when i went with my family to London to meet my cousins</div>
        <div> When i was 14 we first started travelling to a small town along the Costa Del Sol called Nerja. Since then we have visited the town 3 times in the last 5 years </div>
        <div> Other than that i have travelled with friends to both Malaga and London over the last year.</div>
